This site shares some best practices to adopt cloud native, event-driven microservice implementation with Kafka, CI/CD pipeline, Spring Boot Cloud Stream, and API management.

The simple solution presents the following components:

## Repositories part of the proof of technology

* [Rail Query](https://github.com/Travelport-Enterprise/rail-shop-domain)
* [Shop atomic](https://github.com/Travelport-Enterprise/trainline-shop-atomic) Trainline atomic transforms the Rail catalog request to Trainline request and vice versa

## Code you can access too

* [EDA Reference Implementation with polyglote microservices, CI/CD, SAGA, SQRS](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-kc/)
* [IBM active - open source EDA content](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-eda/) with labs, and technology practices
* [A repository to get started with more than hello world on EDA implementation](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/eda-quickstarts)
* [Implementation of the Outbox pattern with Debezium in Quarkus](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/vaccine-order-mgr-pg)
* [MQ source to Kafka Lab with Strimzi or Confluent](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/eda-lab-mq-to-kafka)
* [Kafka Connector Sink lab for Mongodb](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/eda-lab-mongodb)

Most of those repositories are work in progress, you can ask for improvement via git issue, you can open PR.
